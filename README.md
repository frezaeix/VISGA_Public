## Abstract

In order to robustly deploy object detectors across a widerange  of  scenarios,  they  should  be  adaptable  to  shifts  inthe  input  distribution  without  the  need  to  constantly  an-notate  new  data.   This  has  motivated  research  in  Unsu-pervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms for detec-tion.  UDA methods learn to adapt from labeled source do-mains to unlabeled target domains, by inducing alignmentbetween detector features from source and target domains.Yet, there is no consensus on what features to align and howto do the alignment.  In our work, we propose a frameworkthat  generalizes  the  different  components  commonly  usedby UDA methods laying the ground for an in-depth anal-ysis of the UDA design space.  Specifically,  we propose anovel UDA algorithm,  ViSGA, a direct implementation ofour framework, that leverages the best design choices andintroduces a simple but effective method to aggregate fea-tures at instance-level based on visual similarity before in-ducing group alignment via adversarial training.  We showthat both similarity-based grouping and adversarial train-ing allows our model to focus on coarsely aligning featuregroups, without being forced to match all instances acrossloosely aligned domains.  Finally, we examine the applica-bility of ViSGA to the setting where labeled data are gath-ered from different sources. Experiments show that not onlyour method outperforms previous single-source approacheson Sim2Real and Adverse Weather, but also generalizes wellto the multi-source setting.
